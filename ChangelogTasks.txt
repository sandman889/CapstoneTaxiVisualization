CHANGELOG:
  9.11.15 - File created, all memebers have project building and the data is being worked through by all, 
            specified tasks are now created and this file will be used. 
  Begin - The data was put into a SQL server, needs worked through, all members have the proper software installed
            and we have an idea in mind of how to continue the project and the structure we need. General assignments
            will be as follows
            Brendan and Bill:
              -Front end/client side development in javascript and html using various libraries to produce a pleasant
                and useful user experience
            Tom and Tyler:
              -Back end/database/server side development to feed the data and manipulate it as necessary so that 
                Brendan and Bill will have the data they need
            
            Those assignments are tentative and all members will be expected to do work on all parts of the project
             as needed by the changing requirements.
