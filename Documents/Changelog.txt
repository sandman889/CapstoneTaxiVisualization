CHANGELOG:
  12.10.2015:
    -UI reworked again and in its final state, functional on all reasonable screen sizes
    -Dual region query implemented for rectangles, polygons, and circles
    -Trip on line query implemented that will get all trips with pickup/dropoff on the line drawn
    -Nearest point query implemented using Leaflet's marker 
    -Parallel coordinates chart slightly modified and made better
    -Pie chart completed to visualize passenger count
    -Application essentially finished aside from what we would like to do in the future
  11.19.2015:
    -UI redone to be more functional on different sized screens
    -Line, circle and nearest point query completed in SQL
    -Line, and circle query implemented in the interface
    -Parallel coordinates chart created to visualize data
    -Pie chart unfinished to visualize data
    -Bar chart unfinished to visualize data
    -Changed the borough regions to be togglable instead of just drawing them
  11.05.2015 - Lots of progress since last update. It all will be listed here
  				-Map now displays correctly with user interface basic at first expanded later
  				-Queries are linked between the UI and the C# server code and the SQL database
  				-Using ajax to make those calls and dynamically add the data to the page with d3
  				-the points are all drawn using d3.js and are added to the map as a layer
  				-Polygon and rectangle query work correctly
  				-Entire UI has been created as we would like
  				-Can query for dropoff, pickup or both for a region selected
  				-Can display dropoff, pickup or both from a query that has been returned
  				-One month of data still stored, plan on expanding in the future
  				-Can display the borders of all five boroughs within NYC
  				-Can clear all regions and points from the map
  				-Execution has been sped up drastically because it is stored locally now, there is apparently a problem with the server
  				-Popup windows now display when clicking on a point and will display general information about the trip that point is a part of
  				-Popup window will now display in the bottom left for information about the most recent query for data and will appear/refresh on every query
  				-Modular design is the new philosophy behind the UI so that when visualization charts are displayed they can be moved about the screen as the user sees fit
  				 and be resized so the map remains the most 
  				-Many more small imporvements here and there described in the project writeups submitted in the documents folder 
  				
  9.17.15 - A little progress on the leaflet side of things, significant progress on SQL database creation/queries, unable to make progress on 
   		    server side code. Slow week. Not much else to report, still figuring things out

  9.11.15 - File created, all memebers have project building and the data is being worked through by all, 
            specified tasks are now created and this file will be used. 
  Begin - The data was put into a SQL server, needs worked through, all members have the proper software installed
            and we have an idea in mind of how to continue the project and the structure we need. General assignments
            will be as follows
            Brendan and Bill:
              -Front end/client side development in javascript and html using various libraries to produce a pleasant
                and useful user experience
            Tom and Tyler:
              -Back end/database/server side development to feed the data and manipulate it as necessary so that 
                Brendan and Bill will have the data they need
            Tyler:
              -General project design and structure, big picture in mind, task assignments 
            
            Those assignments are tentative and all members will be expected to do work on all parts of the project
             as needed by the changing requirements. 
             
            Application Structure:
              Windows > IIS > SQL Server Database > ASP.NET MVC Web Application
              'WISA' web stack
