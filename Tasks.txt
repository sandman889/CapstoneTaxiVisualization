TASKS:
Sprint 5:
	Tyler:
		-Implement the C# code to interface with the new queries that Tom writes and connect it with the front end as well
		-Extend front end as necessary, other things to be added as I do them... 
	Bill:
		-Create chart using d3 - type TBD
	Brendan:
		-Create chart using d3 - type TBD	
	Tom:
		-Complete the Line query to display trips that cross a line drawn 
		-Complete the circle query so that we can query for circles as well as polygons
		-Work on the line query to display points on a polyline as well
		-Clean up the data if needed (optional)

== Tasks completed in the third and fourth sprints are described in the changelog and in the documents submitted as reports == 

Sprint 2: 9.18.15 - 10.01.15
	Tyler: 
		-Based on what the application needs, create the controller methods that will interface with EF to call the stored procedures to get the necessary data
		-Finish building home server, install all necessary software, and configure it properly so the group may use it for the SQL database
		 	and so it may house our master branch of code for access to present/host 
		-Help group take all of their parts and integrate them into a prototype of the application, this involves teaching everyone about MVC
			and how an MVC app is structured and the right way to do things
		-Help out either Tom or Brendan/Bill as needed
		-Set up and walk the team through setting up an Entity Framework connection within an MVC application to interface with the database
			and show them how to remotely connect to a SQL server hosted on my server, for the data on their local machines 
	Bill/Brendan:
		-Form a design for the web page, doesn't have to be completely fleshed out, but it needs to be functional and moderately attractive
		-Leaflet map will be on the page, you will be able to select at MINIMUM a box on the map to see data from
		-Figure out what Leaflet returns when a box/polygon is selected, work with Tyler to build the interface with the server
        -Plot points based on an array/JSON object of LatLongs
    Tom:
    	-continue working on the SQL database construction, get spatial indexing working properly
    	-improve speed as much as possible
    	-supply query to build database so that Tyler can build it on his server
    	-build a range based query/bounding box that can be interfaced with 

Sprint 1: 9.11.15 - 9.17.15
  Tyler:
    -Begin structuring the server side code to accept the data from the server and from the client side
  Tom: 
    -Finish the SQL query construction to create the table properly with the spatial indexes
  Brendan:
    -Learn how to create points on a map using d3.js and get them working in a test environment
  Bill:
    -Get a leaflet map on the page displaying properly and in the style we want, figure out what data it returns on a selection or if it does at all
